# Machine-Learning-with-sklearn-workflow

standard workflow to build machine learning models. the workflow includes descriptive data analysis, data preprocessing, scaling, dummy variable, train test split, grid search with cross validation, and various evaluation metrics

has the option to apply available machine learning algorithms in sklearn

can be applied to binary classification (diamondsBinary.py), multiclass classification (diamonds.py), and regression problems (diamondsCont.py)

Example: diamond data from kaggle.com
